## Configuration

Before you can fully utilize **CodeTrackr**, you'll need to configure it to sync with your GitHub account.

### Step 1: Git Setup

Ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running the following in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, download and install it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 2: GitHub Authentication

1. Open **VSCode** and go to the **CodeTrackr** settings.
2. The extension will prompt you to authorize it with your GitHub account.
3. Click on the "Authorize" button, and it will open the GitHub OAuth page in your browser.
4. Log in to GitHub and grant the extension the necessary permissions to access your repositories.
5. After authorization, return to VSCode. You should see a message indicating that the extension is connected to your GitHub account.

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Repository

1. Open your project directory in **VSCode**.
2. Initialize your Git repository if it isn't already initialized:

```bash
git init
```

3. Link your local repository to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

4. Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

5. Ensure your **CodeTrackr** extension is tracking the correct repository. If the repository is not listed, check the repository URL and try again.

## GitHub Integration

To ensure smooth integration with **GitHub**, make sure you:

- Have linked your GitHub account to the **CodeTrackr** extension.
- Have proper permissions set for your GitHub repositories (e.g., full control of private repositories).
- Set up the repository correctly with a remote URL pointing to GitHub.

If you encounter issues with GitHub authentication or repository syncing, make sure your GitHub credentials are properly configured in your local Git configuration:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **GitHub authorization issues**: Ensure that you have granted the necessary permissions to the extension when authorizing with GitHub. You can try reauthorizing if needed.
- **Missing repositories**: If your repository is not appearing in the **CodeTrackr** sidebar, ensure that the repository is properly initialized and linked to GitHub.
- **Version conflicts**: If you encounter errors related to version conflicts (e.g., `@types/vscode` version mismatch), refer to the [CodeTrackr setup guide](#configuration) for resolving dependency issues.
